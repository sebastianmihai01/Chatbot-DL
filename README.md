## Formatting data

We have a whole bunch of libraries like nltk (Natural Language Toolkit), which contains a whole bunch of tools for
cleaning up text and preparing it for deep learning algorithms, json, which loads json files directly into Python,
pickle, which loads pickle files, numpy, which can perform linear algebra operations very efficiently, and keras,
which is the deep learning framework weâ€™ll be using.
